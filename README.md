### AI Systems Orchestrator | Local RAG & Infrastructure Architect

I build systems that bridge the gap between "Raw Data" and "AI Intelligence." My focus is on **Local Sovereignty**: creating high-performance RAG pipelines that run entirely on consumer hardware without compromising data privacy.

---

## ⚡ The "400K" Breakthrough
My current architectural focus is on high-density data ingestion. I have successfully engineered a pipeline capable of:
- **Massive Context Ingestion:** Handling **400K+ character files** with zero-loss retrieval.
- **Multi-Source Synthesis:** Orchestrating LLMs to cross-reference multiple disparate data sources to generate a single, high-fidelity response.
- **Zero-Cloud Dependency:** Running the entire stack (Embeddings, Vector DB, LLM) locally via Docker and Ollama.

---

## 🧠 My Engineering Philosophy
I operate as a **Natural Language Architect**. Instead of manual syntax grinding, I leverage AI as a high-level collaborator to design, debug, and deploy complex infrastructures. 

**I focus on the "Structural Integrity" of the system:**
- **Vector Search:** Using **Qdrant** for semantic retrieval that outperforms traditional keyword search.
- **Containerization:** Using **Docker** to ensure my systems are reproducible and scalable.
- **Data Pipelines:** Building deterministic ingestion tools that turn "messy" data into structured JSON/JSONL.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [jsonify2ai](https://github.com/Mugiwara555343/jsonify2ai)
*The Universal Ingestion Engine.*
- **Problem:** AI models are only as good as the data they can remember.
- **Solution:** A local-first RAG system that normalizes TXT, PDF, CSV, and Images into a unified JSONL format for instant semantic indexing.
- **Stack:** Python, FastAPI, Docker, Qdrant, Ollama.

### [note2json](https://github.com/Mugiwara555343/note2json)
*Real-time Memory Spine.*
- A lightweight watcher that converts Markdown/TXT notes into structured JSON in sub-second time, enabling "Live Memory" for local LLM agents.

### [Agent Reworks](https://github.com/Mugiwara555343/cursor-coding-agent-os)
- Optimized local coding agent flows, reducing token consumption by ~60% to enable high-performance development on constrained local VRAM.
