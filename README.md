  # Hey there, I’m Mauricio V

Welcome to my GitHub.

Currenltly, my main focus Is on building a **modular AI memory system** that runs entirely offline, using multiple LLMs across my own hardware, with full routing, memory persistence, and GPU and RAM management.
 

 ## 💡Ideas/Projects Completed and Upcoming  

- Chained multiple local models together (Capybara → Hermes → MythoMax)
- Used Python and JSON files to process and reflect on memory logs — emotion, tone, summaries (parser.py, watcher.py)
- Using Docker to run Ollama, Open Web UI, n8n, & more
- Open Web UI is tunneled with cloudflare and accessed on a domain

## ⏳ (In Progress)
- Sky Watcher, uses data from api.nasa.gov (comets, meteors, etc) and logs fed into custom LLM and saved
- Local App that transcribes voice or other parties, while being fed to LLM, then being processsed and showing real-time suggesttions
- Auto downloader for Instagrams saved reels


## 🎥 [Watcher & Parser Demo Run](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XArldnlAzNk&feature=youtu.be)

In this 2-minute demo, I show a key component of a local-first AI memory system I built from scratch. This is part of a larger assistant architecture I’m building to support intelligent memory recall and context awareness—entirely offline and locally owned.

This GPT helps coordinate tasks across my models and helps with ways to further opitmize the flow and stablity of the architecture. It exists because I couldn’t manage it all myself — so I built something that could take some of the load.

`FastAPI`, `text-generation-webui`, `Open AI` `Ollama`, `FastAPI`, `Gradio`, `LM Studio` and way too many `Python` & `JSON` files...

## 🔭 What’s Next:
- Web dashboard with live GPU routing
- Docker containers per node
- Voice-to-memory pipelines (Whisper + Ollama)
- VPN-secured, MFA-protected orchestration
